# Helmet-and-Number-Plate-detection-using-Image-Processing-Deep-Learning
This project detects motorcyclists with and without helmet and their corresponding number plate. Image processing techniques using computer vision library was used. Different darknet models yolov3-tiny, Yolov3, Yolov4 were modified and trained manually to detect the respective classes.
